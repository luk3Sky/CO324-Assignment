# VoCe: Voice Conference

## Description
Peer to peer communication is a strategy used in applications such as BitTorrent, and Skype. In
this project we're going to design and code a basic peer to peer voice conferencing application similar
to Skype. First, we will implement voice communication between two parties. Then we'ill
extend the application to support multi-party call conferencing. Finally, we'ill measure the
performance of the application under real-world conditions using a network emulator.

## To-Do
- [ ] Voice communication between 2 parties
- [ ] Multi-party conferencing
- [ ] Unit testing using JUnit4
